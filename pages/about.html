            <h1> What is CSGO starter kit?</h1>
            <p> CSGO starter kit is a project for SI539, it is a non profit website that aims at providing basic knowledge for those who are interested in playing csgo. Here, you can find weapon performances and descriptions, popular weapon skins, and news and tips about CSGO. With these resources, we hope you can have a pleasant CSGO experience.</p> 

            <h1> Who is the author?</h1>
            <p> This website is created by 10RE, a noviance in CSGO who want to help himself and other people improve their CSGO skills. 10RE is currently a silver master player will be a silver master player for a long time. 10RE likes to play all kinds of games, including fps, driving, RPG, etc. 10RE's favorite game is <i>the Outer Wilds</i>. </p>

            <h1> What else?</h1>
            <p> Have fun with CSGO and may the god of chicken bless you. </p>

            <h1> Other things about me </h1>
            <p> I majored in Electronic and Computer engineering in my undergraduate study and is currently learning User experience and data analysis as a gradute. Projects I have done are of various fields from hardware design to user interface design. Here are some projects I have done: </p>

            <h2> Q-Learning in Smart Traffic Light Control </h2>
            <p> In this project, we use python to simulate a two-way cross intersection with no turn and build a traffic light system. By using Q-learning algorithm and training the Q-learning model for 1,000,000 times, we obtained an optimized passing time for the traffic light control system under the condition of known car numbers on each lane. </p>

            </div>

            <h2> An Embedded System of Color Extractor </h2>
            <p> In this project, we program on PIC-32 board to build a color extractor that can: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> sense and pick color from environment </li>
                <li> adjust the picked color according to usersâ€™ need </li>
                <li> convert RGB values to a printable color description </li>
                <li> display RGB values and the corresponding color on a screen </li>
                <li> mix pigments according to printable color description, so that the final color is the same as desired one </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p> Challenge in this project is that we write all the drivers for the components attached to the board ourselves, based on communication protocols. We also designed and build the prototype and user interface in this project. </p>
